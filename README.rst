    :alt: Testing Status

Fetch outdoor air quality data from multiple resources, the system is made of
the following components:

* fetching: fetches resources to create the raw material for air
  quality data. That material is saved to create a history and possibility to
  fix errors after the fact.
* data extraction: extract the data from the raw material to create data feeds.
* data reliability: determine which data source is the most reliable at any
  given time.

Architecture
============

The data flow from online resource to reliable data point is broken down as
follow:

* sources: online resources that provide the data, polled at regular interval
  and cached for archive purpose
* feeds: extracted data from sources, feeds are saved as time series in a
  database
* datapoint: extracted from feeds using an election algorithm to provide the
  most reliable data

Configuration
=============

The default local configuration file is ``okqconfig.py``, this can be changed
using the environment variable ``OKQ_CONFMODULE``. The ``okqconfig.py`` file
should define a dict called ``settings``, this dict can be used to overwrite
any configuration option defined in the ``global_settings`` of
``openkongqi.conf``.

Station UUID
============

Each station needs to be attached to a unique identier, a station identifier is
of the following formats::

    CC/STATION
    CC/CITY/STATION
    CC/STATE/CITY/STATION

The following fragments compose the UUID:

* ``CC``: country code - a two letter country code as defined by ISO 3166-1
  alpha-2, mandatory.
* ``STATE``: state name - state name
* ``CITY``: city name - city name
* ``STATION``: stations name - station name, mandatory.

All names have to be expressed in Uppercase or lowercase or numeric latin letters.
